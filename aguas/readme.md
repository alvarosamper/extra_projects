OBJECTIVES:
We are going to carry out a classification project for the treatment of water from an urban wastewater treatment plant. We have a dataset provided by the Autonomous University of Barcelona, and you can find the OpenML link here:
https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=565

This dataset comes from the daily measurements of sensors at an urban wastewater treatment plant. The goal is to classify the plant's operational state in order to predict failures by analyzing the plant's state variables at each stage of the treatment process.

The notebook content is extensive, and all steps are explained in detail, so we'll provide just a brief summary.

BRIEF SUMMARY:
Once we obtained the data, we performed feature engineering. After preparing the data, we tested multiple models, selecting those that provided the best results for further optimization.

Finally, the results were evaluated in detail.
